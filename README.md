# Pre-work - *Tip calculator*

**iTip** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Abby Bassie**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- I designed and implemented my own app icon
- I used a variety of fonts and symbols
- I created a check for the settings screen-- if the user does not provide input for all three default
    tip percentages, an error message will appear and ask the user to provide input

## Notes

I had so much fun building my first IOS app! Building the initial tip calculator was simple, but adding
the settings screen was a challenge for me as a beginner in Swift. I had never
used code to allow communication between two different screens, so I received help from the student
facilitator to complete that portion of the prework. I took notes as the facilitator instructed me,
and I learned quickly. It was great fun!
